Comment Toxicity detection

dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/julian3833/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

This contains comments in textual form that are classified on the level of toxicity and it's nature.
We will build an LSTM based model to predict the toxicity of new comments.

The data is multi - output meaning that each record may correspond to more than one output label.
